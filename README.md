##Exam Topic for Examination at 22nd July

Please do the following task in your group.

The smart Professor T would like to have a system that randomly selects questions from a pool of questions for an exam. Each question has a certain score and is of a certain type. The following question types are available: multiple choice, tasks with additions (cloze) and open questions. A sample solution exists for each question.
At the beginning, the processor should specify the maximum number of points (for example, 90) and the number of questions per question type.
Then an exam is created according to the specifications made previously, and a sample solution is created.
Implement the above task and program the appropriate code. Enter 10 questions with different scores for each question type. Multiple-choice questions have 4 possible answers each (multiple answers are possible). If possible, query the data via a database, otherwise store the information in a class.
